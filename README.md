This module allows the usage of British English spellings within Python.
So, for instance, after installing the word ```colour''' may be used in place of ```color''' in Matplotlib scripts.
Note that this module likely entails a significant performance hit so usage except as a joke is not recommended.

# Usage:

```
from britain import english
'''
